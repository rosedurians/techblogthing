		<h2>Humans Need Not Apply</h2>
		<h4>By Alexander Naveira</h4>

		<p class="paragraphs">The video "Humans Need Not Apply" makes a point about the state of a future with A.I. The video author makes the case that in the very near and real future, there's a good chance of autonomous robots that we create will be able to outdo humans at exceeding rates. According to them, these robots will not only be able to replace humans in more blue-collar or manual labor positions, but they will also be able to create more artistic things like digital art or MIDI composition. </p>

		<h2>A computer ain't takin' my stinkin' job!</h2>

		<p class="paragraphs">While a computer program might be able to make convincing artistic progress, I personally believe it's unlikely that, say, an artist or a musician or someone of that nature would have to worry about their job being taken by the machines. A big part of art is the HUMAN expression that comes along with it - while the music in the abeforementioned video is passable and the feat is impressive but I don't think it's likely that we'll see robots making ACTUAL hits. There's more to the culture of music than can be analyzed by the technology we have now. </p>

		<h2>Blown to Bits</h2>

		<h3>A reflection...</h3>
		<h4>By Alexander Naveira</h4>

		<p class="paragraphs">"Smile While We Snap" explains that while cameras with face recognition technology can be used for good, such as for tracking down criminals and aiding searches - they might also be used for harm as well, and in some cases, can mess with people's lives that haven't done anything THAT bad. It's interesting to note that common people don't really have much control over how this techology is used, so we just have to trust authority.

		<p class="paragraphs">In "Knowing Where You Are", the author talks about how a GPS allows one to track positioning on an XYZ axis, which can obviously be used to find people with a device that might be lost. Most devices of this era have a GPS as our phones and computers connect to the internet on a constant basis, so it goes to show just how common a lot of technology is without people realizing it.

		<p class="paragraphs">RFID tags are a way of tagging individual items or just things through silicon chips, as described in "Knowing Even Where Your Shoes Are". These tags are transferred through radio waves, and while most uses for them are for strictly record keeping, there of course is always the possibility of more strange scenarios where RFID tags directly impact how stores treat you and stuff like that.
